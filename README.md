# Analysis of deep abstraction methods

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used to perform the comparative analysis of deep abstraction methods against SSA.

The experiment contains the following components:
- Generation of the training and testing datasets using SSA.
- Training of a GAN and an MDN deep abstract model using the training datasets.
- Generation of new trajectory data using the trained models.
- Visual analysis of data generated by abstract models vs. data generated by SSA (using the same initial conditions).

In order to reproduce the pipeline locally, a `conda` environment containing the required libraries needs to be created. Use the `conda env create -f environment.yml` command to create a new environment using the specifications provided in the `environment.yml` file.  Note that the enviromnent was originally created on an Apple Silicon machine, which means that the package versions specified in `environment.yml` might need to be adjusted for other architectures and operating systems.
